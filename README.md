One of assemble's biggest strengths is granular control over `context`. This workshop explains how context is created, as well as where, when and why the context works the way it does at each point in the render cycle.

## Install
Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save context-workshop
```

# WIP - nothing to see yet!
