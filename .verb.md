## What is context?

Context is an object that is created in-memory for rendering templates. Context is created by merging objects in the order [specified below](#how-are-the-objects-merged). The context merging presidence is [customizable](#customizing-context) by the user.

---

## What objects are used to create the context?

- `app.cache.data` (from `app.data()`)
  * main data object that is useful for "global" data.
  * usually includes properties like `site` (this is controlled by the user)
- `view.locals`
  * individual view "local" data
  * overrides `app.cache.data` at the individual view level
  * added through middleware or when creating a view with `views.addView()`
- `view.data` (front-matter)
  * individual view data object
  * overrides `app.cache.data` and `view.locals`
  * may be specified as view "front-matter" that is parsed in `onLoad` middleware
  * usually includes properties like `title` and `layout` to override "global" data at the view (page) level
- `render` locals
  * local data object specified when calling the `.render()` method.
  * useful for specifying data that may not exist on `view.locals` or `view.data`
- `helper` locals
  * local data object specified when calling a view helper in another template
  * works with the built-in "singular" view helper (e.g. `{{partial "foo" locals}}`)
  * will override all other data.

## How are the objects merged?

There is a default order of operations when it comes to merging the data context. The order is [customizable](#customizing-context) by the user.

- `app.cache.data`
- `view.locals`
- `render.locals`
- `view.data`
- `helper-locals`

The context is created by merging the objects in the specified order through the various methods discribed in [Customizing context](#customizing-context):

```js
// merges the view context first
// e.g.: `merge(view.locals, locals, view.data)`
var context = view.context(locals);

// merges the `app.cache.data`
context = merge({}, app.cache.data, context);
```

In addition to the main context, helpers may use the `this.ctx()` method to merge in helper locals that are passed.
The built-in singular helpers like `{{partial}}` use this method to ensure helper locals are used.

```handlebars
{{partial "button" locals}}
```

This will result in the `locals` object being merged onto the context when rendering the "button" partial.
The default behaviour for merging the helper context is:

```js
// merge the current "view" front-matter with current context built above
context = merge({}, context, page.data);
// merge in the partial locals and front-matter
context = merge({}, context, button.locals, button.data);
// merge in helper locals and options.hash
context = merge({}, context, locals, options.hash);
```

## Customizing context

Customize how the context object is created.

- `view.context`
  * method that takes optional `locals` object
  * merges data by doing `return merge(view.locals, locals, view.data)`
  * may override directly to change the behaviour
- `app.context`
  * method that takes `view` and optional `locals` object
  * calls the `view.context` before merging data
  * merges data by doing `return merge({}, this.cache.data, view.context(locals))`
- `options.context`: Customize how the context object is created.
  * may override functionality through the `context` option:

```js
app.option('context', function(view, locals) {
  // this is the app
  return merge({}, this.cache.data, view.context(), locals);
});
```
- `options.helperContext`: Custom how the helper context is created.
  * may override the functionality used in the `this.ctx()` method in helpers through the `helperContext` option:

```js
app.option('helperContext', function(view, locals, options) {
  return merge({}, view.context(), locals);
});
```
