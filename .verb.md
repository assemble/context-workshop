## What is context?

Context is an object that is created in-memory for rendering templates. Context is created by merging objects in the order [specified below](#how-are-objects-merged). The context merging presidence is [customizable](#customizing-context) by the user.

...

## What objects are used to create the context?

- `app.cache.data` (from `app.data()`)
  * main data object that is useful for "global" data.
  * usually includes properties like `site` (this is controlled by the user)
- `view.locals`
  * individual view "local" data
  * overrides `app.cache.data` at the individual view level
  * added through middleware or when creating a view with `views.addView()`
- `view.data` (front-matter)
  * individual view data object
  * overrides `app.cache.data` and `view.locals`
  * may be specified as view "front-matter" that is parsed in `onLoad` middleware
  * usually includes properties like `title` and `layout` to override "global" data at the view (page) level
- `render` locals
  * local data object specified when calling the `.render()` method.
  * useful for specifying data that may not exist on `view.locals` or `view.data`
- `helper` locals
  * local data object specified when calling a view helper in another template
  * works with the built-in "singular" view helper (e.g. `{{partial "foo" locals}}`)
  * will override all other data.

...

## How are the objects merged?

There is a default order of operations when it comes to merging the data context. The order is [customizable](#customizing-context) by the user.

- `app.cache.data`
- `render.locals`
- `view.locals`
- `view.data`
- `helper-locals`

...

## Customizing context

Customize how the context object is created.

- `view.context`
- `app.context`
- `options.context`: Customize how the context object is created.
